/**
 *  <p>
 *  This goal is similar to the jetty:run goal in that it it starts jetty on an unassembled webapp, 
 *  EXCEPT that it is designed to be bound to an execution inside your pom. Thus, this goal does NOT
 *  run a parallel build cycle, so you must be careful to ensure that you bind it to a phase in 
 *  which all necessary generated files and classes for the webapp have been created.
 *  </p>
 * <p>
 * This goal will NOT scan for changes in either the webapp project or any scanTargets or scanTargetPatterns.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *  You can configure this goal to run your webapp either in-process with maven, or forked into a new process, or deployed into a
 *  jetty distribution.
 *  </p>
