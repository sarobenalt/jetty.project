/**
 *  This goal is used in-situ on a Maven project without first requiring that the project 
 *  is assembled into a war, saving time during the development cycle.
 *  <p>
 *  The plugin runs a parallel lifecycle to ensure that the "test-compile" phase has been completed before invoking Jetty. This means
 *  that you do not need to explicity execute a "mvn compile" first. It also means that a "mvn clean jetty:run" will ensure that
 *  a full fresh compile is done before invoking Jetty.
 *  <p>
 *  Once invoked, the plugin can be configured to run continuously, scanning for changes in the project and automatically performing a 
 *  hot redeploy when necessary. This allows the developer to concentrate on coding changes to the project using their IDE of choice and have those changes
 *  immediately and transparently reflected in the running web container, eliminating development time that is wasted on rebuilding, reassembling and redeploying.
 *  Alternatively, you can configure the plugin to wait for an &lt;enter&gt; at the command line to manually control redeployment.
 *  <p>
 *  You can configure this goal to run your unassembled webapp either in-process with maven, or forked into a new process, or deployed into a
 *  jetty distribution.
